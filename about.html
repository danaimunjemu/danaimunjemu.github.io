    				<p>Our safaris have a strongly naturalistic character and the mission of our guides is to show you the wonderful world of African nature, whose protagonists are the legendary large animals of the bush: elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, but also a wide variety of wonderful little actors, often unnoticed. Each natural scenery has a history that goes back millions of years and it is our pleasure and privilege to tell you its story and to introduce you to this land of wonders and make your safari unforgettable.
						Our groups are composed of a maximum of 4 or 5 people, to minimize our impact on the environment and make your trip more intimate. We propose itineraries based on our experience, but our real strength is the "tailor-made safari": we build each itinerary according to your needs and passions.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
    		<div class="row">
    			<div class="col-md-12">
    				<p>We don't like to leave Africa outside the door at night: in our journeys we use lodges and hotels as accommodations, but we prefer the tented camp when we are in the wilderness. The camp ensures us safety and allows us to enjoy the magical African night.</p>
					<p>When in the evening we sit around the fireplace, chatting, warming up and getting lost in the hypnotic game of the flames that dance in the dark, without missing the luxury and comforts of the frenetic world that you have temporarly left, you forget about phones, tvs and laptops, deeply lost in the peacefull world you dream every day. We are at the camp, around the fire, lulled by the thousand noises of the African night: the yowling of a hyena, the tinkling of a fruit-eating bat, the mournful song of a nightjar, the dull rumbling of an elephant, the distant grotesque laugh of a hippos in the river, the light breeze caressing the leaves of the trees, the crackle of burning wood. Maybe later, if the bush wuold be generous, we will hear the deep roar of the lion or the rasping roar of the leopard.</p>
					<p>Dinner is just over and it is priceless to rest around the fire with a hot cup of coffee or a glass of Brandy in hand or smoking a cigar, listening and telling stories, embraced by darkness of the wilderness. Later, safely under the blanket in the tent, we will sleep soundly or, if lucky enough to wake up in time, to hear or see, even for a moment, one of the many creatures that visit our sleeping camp under the moon.
						In our itineraries we also accomodate in lodges and hotels, but as far as possible, especially in the wilderness, we use the tented camp. The strong canvas of the large tents provides us safety even during the dark African night, but allows us to hear and sometimes, to see through the mosquito nets what is happening outside, because we don't like leaving Africa out the door at night.</p>
					<p>Tents are 2m x 2m dome tents (suitable for 3 people, but we only accomodate 2 people for each tent, to ensure the best privacy and enough space). Each tent is about 1.7 m heigth and is equipped with mosquito nets on windows and main door. Inside, you'll find camp stretchers with mattresses, pillow and bed-sheet, and an electric bulb. Several pouches and storage compartments are available for your stuffs.
						In the camp kitchen our staff cook full meals, tasting local specialties and products, without however missing out on anything we appreciate most about traditional cuisine.
						In the mobile camps we will be able to use public facilities (toilets and showers), where warm water is usually available. Towels, blankets, bed-sheets, pillow cases and pillows are provided to the guests, and a laundry service is available upon extra charge.
						Our philosophy is to experience Africa minimizing our disturbance to the environment and the impact of our presence in the wilderness. The operate a minimum use of electricity in the camp, but a power inverter is available on the vehicle to recharge mobile phones, cameras and batteries. In the evening, candles, lanterns and fire are the only lights. We don't like noise, because it disturbs both animals and guests and distracts us from what the wilderness whispers to us.
						When darkness has fallen and the last drop of coffee has been sipped, the candles switch off, the tents close and the silence falls down onto the camp. We fall asleep, lulled by the sounds of the African night.</p>
						<p>Good rest and adventurous dreams...</p>

    				<p>A trip cannot be pre-packaged. It would never be the same again. The journey begins long before departure: it starts when the mind lays on a place and the idea of the journey is born.
						We explore maps, read books, listen to stories and everything contributes to building up the project. And everything is already a journey: the departure is not the beginning, but the simple continuation of something that has already begun long before.</p>
						
					<p>Observing a waterfall from afar is wonderful, but only those who are wet from the spray and quenched by the water that has just fallen downstream can say that they have known the waterfall. As well, only those who have heard the lion's roar a few meters away, or heard him walking beyond the canvas of the tent, they can say they have known the lion. The fireplace, the cool evening breeze, the fear of darkness with its thousand sounds, the priceless taste of fresh water in the morning, the dust on the skin. These are things that make a trip memorable.</p>

    				<p>We generally tend to contain the daily transfer within a distance of maximum 300 kms and alternating a transfer day with one, two or more days of stay, rest and activities in the destination. However, some routes are not easyand require low speeds so that 80 km can be covered in 4 or 5 hours. Some transfers, even if contained within 300 km, can last the whole day. However, even these long transfers are never a waste of time: they allow you to see different environments, many of which are of extraordinary beauty; you can see wonderful lanscapes, meet local people from the villages and interact with them. This is also part of the journey.</p>
					<p>Sometimes, an itinerary includes transfers by boats, ferries or even by air and some itineraries include several days in canoes along rivers. For the most demanding guests, we also provide transfers by plane.</p>
					<p>Thus, while the kilometers flow, the red soil, villages, rivers, hills, herds of herbivores, woods and forests pass behind the windows and our next destination is just behind the corner, with a new wonderful surprising experience of Africa.</p>
